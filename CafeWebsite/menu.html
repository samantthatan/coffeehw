            Once you master the espresso base, you can begin constructing the vast array of milk-based drinks found in any specialty cafe. The primary differentiating factors among these classics are the **ratio of espresso to milk** and, most importantly, the **texture of the milk foam**. Milk texturing, known as steaming or frothing, is arguably where the most artistry and technique are applied. Properly steamed milk should be sweet, smooth, and velvety, incorporating microfoamâ€”tiny air bubbles that give the milk a paint-like consistency perfect for pouring latte art. If the milk is too bubbly, it's dry and coarse; if it's too thin, it cannot support latte art and falls flat.

            The difference between a latte and a cappuccino, for instance, is not just milk volume but foam density. A cappuccino traditionally has equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and airy foam, creating distinct layers. A latte, on the other hand, is mostly steamed milk with just a thin, liquid layer of microfoam on top, making it smoother and silkier. Mastering the steam wand involves learning to "stretch" the milk (adding air) only briefly, followed by the "texturing" phase (mixing the air evenly) until the milk reaches $140^{\circ}F$ to $150^{\circ}F$. Too hot, and the sugars burn, ruining the flavor. The recipes below demonstrate how slight variations in these ratios create dramatically different drinking experiences, proving that even with just two main ingredients (coffee and milk), the possibilities are endless in the hands of a skilled barista.

    <h3>Key Ratios for Popular Espresso Drinks</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>**Espresso (Shot):** Pure espresso, no additions. (Volume: 2 oz)</li>
        <li>**Americano:** Espresso diluted with hot water. (Ratio: 1 part espresso to 3 parts water)</li>
        <li>**Macchiato:** Espresso 'marked' with a dollop of milk foam. (Ratio: 2 oz espresso to 0.5 oz milk)</li>
        <li>**Cortado:** Equal parts espresso and steamed milk. (Ratio: 1 part espresso to 1 part milk)</li>
        <li>**Cappuccino:** Equal thirds of espresso, steamed milk, and foam. (Ratio: 1:1:1)</li>
        <li>**Latte:** Espresso with a large amount of steamed milk and a thin microfoam layer. (Ratio: 1 part espresso to 4 parts milk)</li>
    </ol>
